# Electrochemistry

This repository includes code that will:

1. Directly digest the output excel file from PalmSens MultiTrace potentiostat software.
2. Munge the data into a standard dataframe format
3. Plot the data using ggplot2

To do: 
1. Adjusting all baselines to zero
2. Implement integral calculation for chronoamperometric curves
3. t-test comparison between adjusted chronoamperometric normal curves

## Usage 

Step 1: Adjust the path (as long as it's in your working directory) to wherever you saved the data in the "New Code (Autosaved).R" file. 

Step 2: Rip it (just not the old stuff -- will depreciate that later into a different file)
