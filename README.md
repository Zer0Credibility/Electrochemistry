# Electrochemistry

This repository includes code that will:

1. Directly digest the output excel file from PalmSens MultiTrace potentiostat software.
2. Munge the data into a standard dataframe format
3. Plot the data using ggplot2

To do: 
1. Adjusting all baselines to zero
2. Implement integral calculation for chronoamperometric curves
3. t-test comparison between adjusted chronoamperometric normal curves
